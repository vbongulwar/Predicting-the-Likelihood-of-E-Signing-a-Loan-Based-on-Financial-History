Lending companies work by analyzing financial history of their loan applicants, and choosing weather or not the applicant is too risky to be given the loan.If applicant is not , the comapny then determines the terms of the loan. To acquire these applicants,companies recieve this information through their website/apps. Other times ,lending companies work with lending marketplaces, in order to acquire leads of possible applicants.
